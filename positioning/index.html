            <h1>Positioning</h1>
            <p>Positioning is a way to control the layout of elements on a page. There are three types of positioning: static, relative, and absolute. Static positioning is the default positioning of elements. Relative positioning is positioning relative to the normal position of the element. Absolute positioning is positioning relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.</p>
